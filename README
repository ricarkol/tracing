Replayer for the SNIA FIU content traces
----------------------------------------

The usage is best exemplified with one of the tests. For example, https://github.com/ricarkol/tracing/blob/content/test_btreplay.sh#L41

./btreplay/btreplay -l 32 -W mail

replays the trace file "./mail.replay.0" on file "./mail" ("./mail" will be the "device" where all reads and writes are going to). To use an actual device instead, you need to use the -M argument (a map file); like in test "test_write_digest_per_page_no_stalls_mapped" (just replace /opt/dev/mail with /dev/xxx).

There are a couple of important details:
1. reads in the trace are supposed to read some specific content, so the device has to be prepared before hand: the data read in the trace has to be in the device before the replay. That can be done by replaying a trace with all reads treated as writes. Like here: https://github.com/ricarkol/tracing/blob/content/test_btreplay.sh#L4-L13
2. the home traces have a digest per sector, while the mail ones have a digest per page. This is taken care of with the -l argument. The example above which uses the mail trace has -l  32 (32 bytes per page). And the homes trace is replayed with -l 256 (8x32 bytes per page), as in https://github.com/ricarkol/tracing/blob/content/test_btreplay.sh#L93.

Issues
------

- There might be many btreplay arguments that don't work anymore. Only tested the ones in test_btreplay.sh.
